This repository showcases the techniques in C++20 for intermediate-level programmers.

m1-m8 focus on basic concepts including class, object-oriented programming, templates, unique pointers and RAII, threads and locks, type erasion, and asynchronous programming libraries including std::async, std::packaged_task, std::promise, std::future, with an self-implementation for std::function at the end.

m9-m11 focus on more advanced techniques including concurrency models, type concatenation/conversion/reversion in tuples, usage of std::regex, compile-time regular expressions (ctre), and their usage in real-world dataset parsing and analysis, concepts, and to be continued...
