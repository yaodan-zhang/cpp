This repository showcases the usage and techniques in C++20 for intermediate-level programmers.

m1-m8 focus on basic concepts including class, object-oriented programming, templates, threads and locks, and packages including std::async, std::packaged_task, std::promise, std::future, with an self-implementation for std::function at the end.

m9-m11 focus on advanced techniques including concurrency models, type concatenation/conversion/reversion in tuples, std::regex and compile-time regular expressions, real-world dataset analysis with std::regex, (and to be continued.)
